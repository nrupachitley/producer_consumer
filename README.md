# Producer - Consumer Problem

Used Semaphone and Lock from Python Threading Library to solve the synchronization problem

The program takes 4 user inputs:
  * Sleeptime for producer
  * Sleeptime for consumer
  * Number of producer threads
  * Number of consumer threads

The program successfully synchronizes producer and consumer threads and prints status of buffer after every producer and consumer call
